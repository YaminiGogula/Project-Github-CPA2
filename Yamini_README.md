### 🧠 My Projects

- **📈 Project:
  
  1. **Carbon Emission Analysis for NYC Taxis 🚕🌍**
  
This project utilizes PySpark in Databricks to conduct an exploratory analysis of the NYC Taxi Limousine Commission Dataset. The analysis focuses on calculating carbon emissions for taxi rides, comparing emissions based on the number of passengers, and providing actionable recommendations to reduce emissions in the future. Visualizations were created using Matplotlib to present emissions trends and insights.

**Key Features:**

CO2 emissions calculation for each taxi ride based on distance traveled.
Comparative analysis of emissions between 1-2 passengers vs 3+ passengers.
Recommendations for carbon emission reduction strategies in the taxi industry.
Matplotlib visualizations to display emission trends over time.

2. **IoT Data Processing and Visualization for Smart City Insights 🌆📊**

This project demonstrates the end-to-end data pipeline setup and analysis for smart city sensor data using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Cosmos DB. Key metrics such as Air Quality Index, Traffic Density, and Energy Consumption were calculated using PySpark in Databricks, and visualized in a Power BI dashboard to provide actionable insights for city planners. 🚀

**-Key Features:**

Automated data ingestion and processing of IoT sensor data.
Calculation of environmental metrics using PySpark.
Scalable data storage in Cosmos DB.
Power BI dashboard to visualize key city metrics.
